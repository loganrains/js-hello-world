Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed. X
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? X - it will not run without
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")? X - They appear interchangeable
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;. X - Nice, I tend to forget these
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together). X 
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other. X
   7. Print two messages on the same line. X
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore". X
